                    During the Summer/Fall of 2021, DART developed a 2-hour Verbal De-escalation online training for a
                    retail establishment in Boulder, Colorado. It was delivered using the Zoom platform. The reviews
                    were very positive. Similar trainings are planned for other retail firms and will be offered to
                    healthcare facilities in 2022.
