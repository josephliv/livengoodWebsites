            <p>I started working on computers around 20 years ago, self-taught mostly until I went to college in
                2005 where I studied Computer Networking Technology.

            <p>
                I have since worked in several professional environments including Sony and HP refurbished laptops.

                I could go on and on with a list of where all I worked dealing with computers both hardware and
                software. If you need help at all, ask me and I'll be happy to assist.

                    <p> Around 1999 I had a huge interest
                        in learning a foreign language. I worked at a factory at the time where I was exposed to the Spanish
                        language.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At that time I was living alone and had a friend that needed a place to stay. He didn’t know any English
                        so I took it upon myself the desire to learn Spanish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It took me around 2 years to become fluent. I have lived in Peru for over 10 years where I got married.
                        We are now in the state of North Carolina and speak mostly Spanish at home.

                <p>The story behind this is sort of long so I’ll keep it as short as possible.

                <p>
                    While in college in 2005, web design was part of our studies and it really interested me. However, upon
                    completion, I had to let it go due to being a computer technician and the coding skills were not needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2015 my boss at that time asked if I could help him complete his website. I offered to help but he
                    wanted more than what I knew how to do, so that’s when I got serious and started studying HTML and CSS
                    to make it responsive. Here’s the very first site I put together from scratch. <a href="https://livengood.yolasite.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> Opens in a new
                        tab.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have since then studied Javascript, node, WordPress, backend PHP and helped build project using
                    frameworks such as Laravel and CodeIgniter.
