        Hi, I'm Joe. Since 2020, I've been focused on one thing: building websites that help 
  businesses connect with their customers. No fancy jargon, no overblown promises - 
  just reliable solutions that get results.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based in North Carolina, I've transformed what started as a curious 'let me figure this out' moment into a God-given passion for creating websites that truly serve a purpose.
        </p>
        Here's my promise: I don't do generic, template-based websites. If you're looking for a quick drag-and-drop solution, there are plenty of those out there. But if you want something that makes your competitors nervous and your visitors to click 'contact' - let's have a conversation.

                <p>I started working on computers around 20 years ago, self-taught mostly until I went to college in
                    2005 where I studied Computer Networking Technology.

                    I have since worked in several professional environments including Sony and HP refurbished laptops.

                    I could go on and on with a list of where all I worked dealing with computers both hardware and
                    software. If you need help at all, ask me and I'll be happy to assist.

            <div id="disc">
                <p> Around 1999 I had a huge interest
                    in learning a foreign language. I worked at a factory at the time where I was exposed to the Spanish
                    language.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At that time I was living alone and had a friend that needed a place to stay. He didn’t know any English
                    so I took it upon myself the desire to learn Spanish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It took me around 2 years to become fluent. I have lived in Peru for over 10 years where I got married.
                    We are now in the state of North Carolina and speak mostly Spanish at home.

                <p>The story behind this is sort of long so I’ll keep it as short as possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While in college in 2005, web design was part of our studies and it really interested me. However, upon
                    completion, I had to let it go due to being a computer technician and the coding skills were not needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2015 my boss at that time asked if I could help him complete his website. I offered to help but he
                    wanted more than what I knew how to do, so that’s when I got serious and started studying HTML and CSS
                    to make it responsive. Here’s the very first site I put together from scratch. <a href="https://livengood.yolasite.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> Opens in a new
                        tab.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have since then studied Javascript, node, WordPress, backend PHP and helped build project using
                    frameworks such as Laravel and CodeIgniter.
