    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    Today, your website is often the first place potential customers interact with your business. A well-designed website makes a great first impression, builds trust, and shows your credibility.</p>
    <p> As an independent web designer in North Carolina, I create custom websites that engage and convert visitors. Unlike many others, I work alone, so every site is personally crafted by me, ensuring a unique and dedicated approach to your project.
