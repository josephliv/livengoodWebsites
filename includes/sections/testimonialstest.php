        <p class="testimonial-text">"I hired Joe to re-do my law firm's website. I loved my old website, but after nearly twenty years with the company that had designed and built it for me, I had grown unhappy with the deterioration in the level of service I was receiving from that company and my site was losing visibility.<br>

            A good friend referred me to Joe. The old site was not built on a well-known platform, but Joe was able to copy all of the content from my own site -- most of which I had written myself -- and use it in the new site. Joe was a pleasure to work with. He was prompt, knowledgeable, he kept me informed, he listened to me, and his fees were reasonable. I highly recommend him."</p>
