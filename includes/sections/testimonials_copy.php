                I appreciated the way that you tailored the class to what I said I needed. I
                was amazed at how that was done so easily to incorporate the medical
                aspect of workplace violence. The professionalism of all the instructors was
                well noted and appreciated.

                I believe that almost any institution could benefit from this training. I
                certainly see the benefit for secondary schools.

                This type of instruction is so important. One of the valued lessons I took
                away....was how to verbally control situations, how not to give control back
                to the abuser/intruder....It is comforting to know there is a group like DART
                available to health professionals.

                I was very impressed with the content and quality of the material
                presented. The DART team is a high energy, fun group who passed along an
                incredible amount of information in a concise format....I would recommend
                this seminar to any office or group who deals with the public.

                The purpose of the inservice was to increase staff awareness of potentially
                dangerous situations and learn techniques to improve the safety of both
                staff and patients. The response of the team following the inservice was
                excellent...The quality of the inservice, along with the enthusiasm with
                which it was presented was outstanding.
