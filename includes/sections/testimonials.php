          <p>I hired Joe to re-do my law firm's website. I loved my old website, but after nearly twenty years with the company that had designed and built it for me, I had grown unhappy with the deterioration in the level of service I was receiving from that company and my site was losing visibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            A good friend referred me to Joe. The old site was not built on a well-known platform, but Joe was able to copy all of the content from my own site -- most of which I had written myself -- and use it in the new site. Joe was a pleasure to work with. He was prompt, knowledgeable, he kept me informed, he listened to me, and his fees were reasonable. I highly recommend him.

            <p>Joe was an absolute pleasure to work with! Our company needed a last minute website creator to assist with finishing up our website by the end of the year. I found Joe and he completely took the weight off my shoulders! He's experienced, knowledgeable, extremely kind, understanding, and accommodating. He was able to accomplish everything I wanted in just 3 days. </p>
            <p>
              I appreciated that he really took the time and effort to frequently communicate with me to make sure my expectations were being met. I will be keeping in touch for future projects and any website assistance! Thank you Joe!!! ðŸ˜Š

              person, I really appreciate that he would explain what I needed to

            <p>Livengood Websites offers premium customer service - if you aren't
              happy, he will make things right. I've worked with Joseph for several
              years and can recommend him to get the job done. He has many resources
