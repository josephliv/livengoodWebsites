            Back in the 90s and even early 2000's all you needed to be on the front page of Google was just a lot of
            keywords and content.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even a lot of views to your page would boost it, but now in 2023, it's really not that easy. Here's what
            Google is looking for:

            <h3 style="text-align: left;">1. Engagement/interest</h3>
            <div class="custom-section">
                <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/assets/imgs/posts-imgs/interested.jpg" alt="interesting">
                <div class="post-content">

                    <p> This is the most important of all the rest which is why I mentioned it first.
                        Google now goes by how long a visitor stays on your website. This tells Google that they are
                        interested in what you have. </p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;">2. Keywords</h3>
        <div class="custom-section">

            <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/assets/imgs/posts-imgs/seo-keywords.jpg" alt="seo keywords">
            <div class="post-content">

                <p>
                    As we all know, keywords are important, but where should they go is the question. In the old days,
                    you
                    could just list a lot of them on the bottom of your page and within the meta tags (HTML code), and
                    boom,
                    you are listed on Google. By not so easy today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now the keywords must fit nicely within the title tags and paragraph tags throughout the page where
                    they make sense. Usually
                    within the first two and last two paragraphs.

        <h3 style="text-align: left;">3. Naming Your Images</h3>
        <div class="custom-section">
            <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/assets/imgs/posts-imgs/images.png" alt="Naming Images and Adding An Alt Tag">
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>
                    This is very important if you want your images to show up. The thing is, the spiders (the software
                    that
                    search engines use to read your pages) do not see images.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So it's very important to both add alt images and to name the images correctly. The alt text is the
                    HTML
                    part, it looks like this<br><span class="code"><span>
                            << /span>img src="path/image.jpg" <u><b>alt="Name of the image</b>"</u><span>></span>
                        </span>. If you do not know how to do this, you can hire an expert who can help.
