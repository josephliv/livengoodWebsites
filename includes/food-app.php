          Frankly speaking, we cannot keep an ongoing updated view on every detail of any specific alternative solution.
          If there is a very specific aspect you are interested in I may be able to answer or find out but I cannot
          provide a relevant 360 analysis which probably will be so long that you won't have time to study anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are thousands of solutions out there, no one can keep track of each one of them.
