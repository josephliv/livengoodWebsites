        Frankly speaking, we cannot keep an ongoing updated view on every detail of any specific alternative solution.
        If there is a very specific aspect you are interested in I may be able to answer or find out but I cannot
        provide a relevant 360 analysis which probably will be so long that you won't have time to study anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are thousands of solutions out there, no one can keep track of each one of them.

      <p>What I do know is that:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Our platform stands for a "simplified" online ordering experience for small and medium restaurants, designed
          to maximize sales, frequency of repeat orders, and viewer to orderer conversion.</li>

        <li>Moreover, we provide the best promo and coupons module in the industry - you'll be hard-pressed to find a
          system that allows you to set up crazy promotions like ours.</li>

        <li>We're also leaders in performance and system stability. Our solution is a HA cloud-based system sitting on
          an Amazon AWS grid and interconnected with many other 3rd party services (Amazon push, Google, push, Apple
          push, payment processors, Twillio, etc).</li>
