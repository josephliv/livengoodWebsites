        Frankly speaking, we cannot keep an ongoing updated view on every detail of any specific alternative solution.
        If there is a very specific aspect you are interested in I may be able to answer or find out but I cannot
        provide a relevant 360 analysis which probably will be so long that you won't have time to study anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are thousands of solutions out there, no one can keep track of each one of them.

      <p>What I do know is that:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Our platform stands for a "simplified" online ordering experience for small and medium restaurants, designed
          to maximize sales, frequency of repeat orders, and viewer to orderer conversion.</li>

        <li>Moreover, we provide the best promo and coupons module in the industry - you'll be hard-pressed to find a
          system that allows you to set up crazy promotions like ours.</li>

        <li>We're also leaders in performance and system stability. Our solution is a HA cloud-based system sitting on
          an Amazon AWS grid and interconnected with many other 3rd party services (Amazon push, Google, push, Apple
          push, payment processors, Twillio, etc).</li>

          With your order, you will also be provided with an app to accept or reject orders as they come in and provide the
          delivery estimated time to the client.

          Take payments straight from your app or website WITHOUT any fees, you keep 100% of your money!
