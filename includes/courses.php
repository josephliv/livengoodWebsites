            <strong>DART</strong> has developed a number of trainings tailored to specific
            organizational needs. They include
            WorkSmart trainings (Verbal De-escalation Training and a Train-the-Trainer Course), DateSmart –
            Healthy Relationships and Teen Dating Violence Prevention (1-hour, 3-hour), and Fight Back 101 (a 2-
            hour personal safety class). In-person and Zoom training options are available.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>DART’s goals</strong> in every WorkSmart training session are to enhance employee confidence, ensure
            a safer
            workplace environment, and positively impact employee retention. DateSmart’s goals are to offer young
            people the knowledge, skills, and tools they need to avoid becoming either targets or perpetrators of
            dating violence and to develop healthy interpersonal relationships.
