        <p><strong>DART</strong> has developed a number of trainings tailored to
            specific
            organizational needs. They
            include WorkSmart trainings (Spectrum Level 1 and Verbal De-escalation Training), DateSmart Training
            (1-hour, 3-hour), and Fight Back 101 (a 2-hour personal safety class). Because of COVID-19,
            <strong>DART</strong> currently
            offers only two trainings either online or by Zoom: a 2-hour WorkSmart Verbal De-escalation Training and a
            2-hour DateSmart training.</p>

            <strong>DART</strong>'s goals in every WorkSmart training session are to enhance employee
            confidence, ensure
            a safer workplace environment, and positively impact employee retention. DateSmart’s goals are to offer
            young people the knowledge, skills, and tools they need to avoid becoming either targets or perpetrators of
            dating violence and to develop healthy interpersonal relationships.

                Participants gain a fundamental understanding of the power of verbal de-escalation techniques and
                situational awareness.
